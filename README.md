# Scite Extension #

## Building ##

```
$ npm i
$ npm run build
```

Then the extension is in `extension`

## Developing ##

Serve the root directory with a static file server:

```
$ python -m http.server 8001
```

Run the dev build:

```
$ npm run dev
```

Go to `http://localhost:8001`

Note you will probabaly want to disable the 'real' extension if you have it installed! Otherwise they can conflict...
